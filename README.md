# Experiments

A scratchpad repository for trying out ideas, code snippets, and small demos.

## Getting Started
- Ensure you have the required runtime or toolchain installed for the specific experiment (Python, Node.js, etc.).
- Install any dependencies noted in the experiment's folder (e.g., `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- Run the experiment using the command documented in its directory (commonly `npm start`, `python main.py`, or similar).

## Repository Structure
- Each experiment should live in its own subdirectory with a short name.
- Include a brief README or comments within each experiment explaining its purpose and how to run it.
- Keep experiments self-contained so they can be run independently.

## Contributing Notes
- Keep commits small and focused on a single experiment.
- Prefer clear naming and minimal dependencies.
- Add quick notes on results or observations so future you knows what worked.
